# HTML-CSS-Refactor
My motivation for doing this project was to improve my coding skills by learning how to consolidate my code and create a better layout of it so that if me or anyone else who looks at it can easily understand and know what each code reprsents in terms of the actual browser page. I think a key things this project helped toward solving is my understanding for the fact that there are many ways you can code, but always remembering to make it so anyone can come in and know what they are looking at wihtout looking at the browser. What makes my project stand out is that my page still 100% works even after changing alot of things in the code.
